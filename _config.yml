  Hi, my name is Borana and I'm currently a PostDoctoral researcher in Computational Neuroscience.
  I am well used to working within an interdisciplinary team, where theoreticians, programmers, biologists and clinicians come together to provide innovative approaches to health and diagnostics.
  My work has also taught me autonomy, adaptability and perserverance.

  I recently obtained my PhD in "Modelling brain stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy", where I used individualized Virtual Brain Models to study brain stimulation in epilepsy.
  I have solid knowledge in computer science and applied mathematics, where I obtained an engineering degree in Grenoble INP - ENSIMAG.

  I love applying mathematics to physical and biological phenomena, in particular for health and clinical applications ! I also am amazed by the brain and what it can do.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Programming</mark>, <mark>Brain imaging</mark>, <mark>Modelling</mark> and <mark>Simulations</mark>.

#          Building virtual brain twins and simulated brain activity of real patients with drug-resistant epilepsy
#        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
#          The goal of this project was to build a synthetic copy of an empirical dataset of 30 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
##          People with drug-resistant epilepsy suffer from intractable seizures and can be treated with brain surgery.
##          Their chance of becoming seizure-free heavily relies on proper diagnosis of brain regions responsible for seizure generation, known as epileptogenic zones (EZ).
##          In the clinic, empirical recordings of brain activity are used to estimate these brain regions.
##          However, the underlying ground truth is not available.
##          We built a virtual cohort of 30 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, using individual patientsâ€™ data to simulate their epileptic brain activity.
##          This brain modeling based on personalized data is referred to as a virtual brain twin.
##          The key parameters of these virtual brain twins including the EZ settings serve as the ground-truth.
##          Epileptic brain activity is simulated at the whole-brain level and mapped onto intracranial sensors to mimic real recordings. We quantified how well the synthetic signal captured features from the empirical data.
##          For each virtual brain twin, we generated spontaneous seizures, stimulated seizures and interictal activity.
##          This cohort is made available to the scientific community to benchmark methods such as estimation of EZ and source localization.

#          Using virtual brain twins to predict brain stimulation responses in-silico.
#        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
#          Following my PhD thesis work, I am continuing to use individualized virtual brain models to predict stimulation response in drug-resistant epilepsy. Here, I am using brain imaging data to parametrize the virtual brain twins and performing simulations to compare the outcome to the empirical data. Using a <mark>genetic algorithm</mark> approach, I am estimating the parameters of the virtual brain twin that can predict the empirical data.

##          Modeling brain stimulation for diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy
##        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
##          I completed a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, using virtual brain models to diagnose drug-resistant epilepsy.
##          My project was focused on modelling the effects of <mark>brain stimulation</mark> in epilepsy, in particular when triggering seizures.
##          To this end, I extended an existing model to account for brain stimulation effects in seizure generation in epilepsy, which I tested and validated in a synthetic cohort of 30 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
##          In addition, the modelling framework was extented for high-resolution virtual brain models and non-invasive stimulation, demonstrating a potential methodology for purely <mark>non-invasive diagnosis</mark> of drug-resistant epilepsy.
